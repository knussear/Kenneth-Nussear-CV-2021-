	abstract = {The ‘bet hedging’ life history strategy of long-lived iteroparous species reduces short-term reproductive output to minimize the risk of reproductive failure over a lifetime. For desert-dwelling ectotherms living in variable and unpredictable environments, reproductive output is further influenced by precipitation and temperature via effects on food availability and limits on activity. We assembled multiple (n = 12) datasets on egg production for the threatened Agassiz’s desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii across its range and used these data to build a range-wide predictive model of annual reproductive output as a function of annual weather variation and individual-level attributes (body size and prior-year reproductive status). Climate variables were more robust predictors of reproductive output than individual-level attributes, with overall reproductive output positively related to prior-year precipitation and an earlier start to the spring activity season, and negatively related to spring temperature extremes (monthly temperature range in March–April). Reproductive output was highest for individuals with larger body sizes that reproduced in the previous year. Expected annual reproductive output from 1990-2018 varied from 2–5 eggs per female per year to 6-–12 eggs, with a weak decline in expected reproductive output over this time (p = 0.02). Climate-driven environmental variation in expected reproductive output was highly correlated across all 5 Recovery Units for this species (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.9). Overall, our model suggests that climate change could strongly impact Agassiz’s desert tortoise reproductive output, and could have a negative population-level effect if precipitation is significantly reduced across the species’ range as predicted under some climate models.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to investigate the role of land cover changes through time in influencing spatial variability of the surface urban heat island of the metropolitan area of Reno-Sparks, Nevada. Thermal imagery from Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor was gathered for a period between 2004 and 2017. Using parcel data, the time series of Landsat data was sampled for areas that had undergone development during that time. A set of generalized linear models was conducted to determine expected temperature change with land cover class. It was found that recently developed regions within Reno-Sparks are 0.6oC warmer on average than the undeveloped desert grasses and sage. When wetlands/irrigated greenery were converted, it resulted in an increase of over 2oC. This research has shown that the Reno-Sparks surface urban heat island has undergone local, but measurable, growth in the past fourteen years.},

	abstract = {We challenged the common practice of using a single mean absorptance based on unfiltered skylight spectra to model operative temperature for reptiles in filtered light habitats by examining the effects of plant canopies on light transmittance. To assess differences in light filtration over a range of microhabitats, spectra were recorded under canopies of desert plants, tropical plants, and under unfiltered skylight. Spectra were then integrated with absorptivity curves of desert reptiles to determine if differences in light quality among microhabitat types changed integrated mean absorptance. Finally, we used the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study to investigate the effects of filtered microhabitats on paint choice for physical operative temperature models and determined the magnitude of error that could result from discrepancies between paint and animal absorptance. We found that light energy was partitioned similarly among microhabitats with like canopy types and that most variation was explained by differences in transmittance between the visible and near infrared wavelengths. Mean absorptance for reptiles was similar among microhabitats with the greatest differences observed between animals in unfiltered skylight and under tropical canopies. In most microhabitats paint and tortoise absorptances differed, but operative temperatures were nearly identical within microhabitats no matter the absorptance used in the model. The findings of this study support the use of a single mean absorptance in modeling operative temperature for reptiles in a variety of habitats.},

	abstract = {Landscape-scale habitat changes including urbanization, increased wildfires, and invasive species are rapidly increasing throughout the southwestern United States. While extensive research and conservation efforts have been directed towards understanding the effects of altered habitats in adult tortoise populations, little is known about habitat features that may support younger tortoise cohorts. To understand the relationship between habitats and the ecological requirements for juvenile tortoises, we conducted a multi-year study (Fall 2014 – Spring 2017) using translocated captive juvenile Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) at three desert sites in Clark County, Nevada, USA. We surveyed site features including annual and perennial vegetation, soil textures, rodent burrows, climate features, etc. at each site. In addition, we monitored growth, health, movement, and survival for juvenile tortoises. After evaluating habitat and climate patterns during the project, we found that annual plant production best explained patterns of improved performance (growth, survival) in juveniles. Annual plants were highly variable both in production and species richness throughout 2015 and 2016, with limited production in 2015. Consequently, we also recorded limited growth for most juveniles throughout that year. We found that juveniles generally grew more, increased movement and home range, and had higher survival in habitats with less invasive non-native annual vegetation (e.g. Bromus rubens, Schismus barbartus) compared to sites with increased native forage plants. Our findings support previous research on the potential negative effects of non-native annual plants for young tortoises. When possible, reducing non-native vegetation or protecting habitats from potential plant invasions and other disturbances may improve recruitment and conservation for this species.},

	abstract = {The Mojave Desert is a vast and diverse landscape in the southwestern United States, encompassing 127,689km2. This ecoregion is bordered by the colder and wetter Great Basin desert to the north, and the warmer and wetter Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts to the south. Spanning from 86m below sea level at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California, to 3632m at its highest mountains near Las Vegas, Nevada, the Mojave is the driest of the four North American deserts, in part due to the rain-shadow caused by the Transverse Ranges on its western edge. Extremes of moisture availability, temperature, physiographic variety, and soil diversity all are key in the formation of this unique landscape, and the divergence of its inhabitants over time. While the Mojave is often considered an intermediary with respect to the plants and animals that occupy the Great Basin and Sonoran Deserts, there are many species unique to the Mojave that aid in highlighting its unique characteristics. The Joshua Tree, Mojave Desert Tortoise, Mohave ground squirrel, and several species of fringe-toed lizards are all endemics to this ecoregion that have adapted to this austere environment. There is also a wide array of fishes and aquatic invertebrates that occupy the Mojave's sparse and discontinuous waterways and springs. Nearly all of these Mojave endemics are the subjects of conservation concern facing a rapidly changing environment driven by increasing human populations and land use, and a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive fecal genotyping can be a useful tool for population monitoring of elusive species. We tested extraction protocols on scat samples from the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, to evaluate whether scat-based mark–recapture and population genetic monitoring studies are feasible. We extracted DNA from G. agassizii scat samples collected in California and Nevada using several extraction protocols and evaluated the reliability of resulting genotypes using quality scores, maximum likelihood reliability estimates, and paired scat and blood genotypes from the same individuals. Finally, we assessed probabilities of identity and sibship, and locus amplification quality, and calculated genotyping error rates for 19 microsatellite loci to determine the best set of loci to use with G. agassizii scat extractions. We found that genotype quality depended more on the sample quality than on the extraction method, and that the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini extraction kit is an efficient method for extracting DNA from tortoise scat. We identified 6 G. agassizii microsatellite loci that can be used to generate a unique molecular tag for individual tortoises. We characterized the reliability of an additional 13 microsatellite loci for use in population genetic analyses where additional power at the expense of some increase in error may be advantageous. As proof of concept, with very low error rates, we matched 3 opportunistically collected scat samples to blood genotypes from animals captured during population surveys within the study area and discovered at least 3 new individuals, even after 2 yrs of extensive survey work. These results suggest that genotyping of field-collected scat can complement existing methods used in long-term demographic and movement studies of G. agassizii and other, closely related, tortoise species.},

	abstract = {Off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation is increasing throughout the southwestern US, and can adversely affect habitat and abundance of many plants and animals. Within the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreational Area (ISDRA) in southeast California, USA, management plans have been implemented since 1974 and more intensely since 2000 to manage OHV activity in order to reduce disturbance impacts to sensitive wildlife such as the Colorado fringe-toed lizard (Uma notata) and sensitive plants. To understand the relationship among habitat, disturbance, and the ecological requirements for Uma lizards, we conducted a multi-year study (2014-2016) using stratified randomly placed transects throughout five ISDRA management areas. We surveyed environmental parameters including geographic location, air and surface temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, cloud cover, presence and number of OHV tracks, trash, and crushed vegetation as well as the abundance of key perennial vegetation species along each transect. We found that surface temperature (30-48 °C) and the abundance of the perennial plant Eriogonum deserticola best explained lizard detection and density. Lizard density increased in habitats providing the largest sand dunes and longer-term management (since 2000) restricting OHV activity. Although Wilderness areas within ISDRA were closed to OHV recreation in 1974, we found fewer lizards there than in other protected areas; much of the Wilderness area was represented by dunes stabilized by Larrea tridentata scrub vegetation or interspersed by ancient lakebed clay soils and may not represent optimal habitat for Uma lizards. Our finding supports that management actions reducing OHV activity in high sand dune habitats over longer periods ({\textgreater}15 years) will likely increase the density of Colorado fridge-toed lizards and promote habitat features needed to support robust populations},

	abstract = {Corvids are a native species in the Mojave Desert, but their population has increased throughout the years due to resources provided by humans (ex. landfills, agriculture, standing water etc.).Increased presence of Common Ravens may have negative impacts on critically endangered or threatened species with overlapping home ranges, such as the Desert Tortoise. We are developing statistical models to provide spatial context of Common Raven (Corvus corvax) nest density, nesting preferences, and nesting success throughout Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) Critical Habitat Units (CHU) in the Mojave Desert of California. This work will increase our understanding on the potential influence of anthropogenic features and subsidies in the desert, provide a spatial context on Common Raven threats to Desert Tortoise populations, and may have the potential to improve management tools and practices in managing the Common Raven populations, which may aid in recovering Desert Tortoise populations.

The Mojave Desert Ecosystem encompasses approximately 1,918,252 hectares of critical habitat for the Desert Tortosie. Due to the large spatial scale of targeted study areas, data were collected to optimize raven observations during nesting season (March-June), which resulted in spatial bias in the observations toward transmission pole lines and roads. To reduce bias, we will analyze nest survey data by using a variety of spatial methods, including spatial bootstrapping comparisons with null models, point process models, and geostatistical analyses. We will analyze nest site selection to determine differences in habitat attributes that may influence nest site preference (such as resources or topography). Nest density and nest success will be modeled to analyze the influence of anthropogenic resources and nesting substrate selection. Covariates for each model will include: proximity to resources (landfills, agriculture, water source), proximity to roads and urbanized areas, nest substrate type, and local estimates vegetation density, temperature, and precipitation.},

	title = {Rangewide environmental sensitivities of {Mojave} {Desert} tortoise demographic rates: {New} insights from old data},
	abstract = {Effective management of threatened and endangered species (TES) requires accurate assessment of vulnerability to environmental changes and of the adaptive capacity to weather those changes. The Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) provides an excellent system for studying population resilience to environmental change, as many populations have been monitored extensively across its range, allowing us to leverage long-term longitudinal demographic data across diverse environments. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing for decades, capture mark-recapture (CMR) surveys were conducted repeatedly at dozens of 2.6 km2 ‘permanent study plots’ across the range of the species. Although primarily used for estimating abundance trends, these permanent study plots represent an invaluable resource for estimating the environmental sensitivities of key tortoise demographic rates. We are currently leading an effort to re-analyze the permanent study plot data where the species occurs in Nevada and northeastern Arizona using modern spatial capture-recapture methods (SCR). Results from these re-analyses confirm that adult tortoise survival is largely insensitive to environmental gradients; however, recruitment and short-distance movement rates appear to be more variable and sensitive to climatic and edaphic conditions. In addition, we were able to generate tortoise density estimates with greater precision using SECR than were possible under previous analytical approaches. These analyses represent a critical first step in our efforts to assess the climate resilience of Mojave Desert Tortoise populations and to identify critical habitat areas capable of supporting tortoise populations long into the future.},

	abstract = {Maintaining historic corridors for gene flow is crucial to ensuring the survival and recovery of threatened and endangered species. The Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is federally listed as a threatened species, and inhabits a wide array of habitat types. Major desert tortoise population centers are located within relatively flat bajadas and valleys while passes through mountain ranges can serve as important corridors linking those population centers. Desert tortoises are generally corridor-dwellers, so effective corridors must be able to sustain individuals living in the corridors to serve as linkages between populations. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be a useful tool to identify and locate corridors, though low resolutions of predictions may obscure features (e.g. cliff faces) that act as important barriers to desert tortoise movement. Two potential corridors through mountain passes around the Ivanpah Valley, NV/CA were located using predictions from a previously developed model (1-km2 resolution). Movements of all known adult tortoises (n = {\textasciitilde}100) on 1-km2 plots within the corridors were tracked for three years with VHF telemetry and GPS loggers. Comparing these tortoise locations with the habitat prediction suggests that tortoises are not necessarily using space as predicted by the model. To improve modeling of these and other corridors, we explore two different methods of rescaling SDMs to improve their predictive abilities. We downscaled the original model using a cubic spline algorithm and created a new ensemble model using smaller resolution predictor variables. We compared these two model predictions of tortoise use within the corridors to actual tortoise use. Understanding how these two approaches predict tortoise use of corridors can help identify other natural corridor use that is important to desert tortoise population connectivity.},
