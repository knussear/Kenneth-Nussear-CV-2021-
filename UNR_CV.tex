\begin{rSection}{Professional Interests}
My research program seeks to understand both human-caused and natural influences on the geographic distribution of species and their habitat – integrating principles of Conservation Biology, Wildlife Biology and Management with Spatial Ecology so that we can gain a richer understanding of what challenges species face, and where on the landscape different influences and management decisions are likely to be important and effective.
