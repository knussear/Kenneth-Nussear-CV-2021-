Thermal imagery from Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor was gathered for a period between 2004 and 2017. Using parcel data, the time series of Landsat data was sampled for areas that had undergone development during that time. A set of generalized linear models was conducted to determine expected temperature change with land cover class. It was found that recently developed regions within Reno-Sparks are 0.6oC warmer on average than the undeveloped desert grasses and sage. When wetlands/irrigated greenery were converted, it resulted in an increase of over 2oC. This research has shown that the Reno-Sparks surface urban heat island has undergone local, but measurable, growth in the past fourteen years.},

For desert-dwelling ectotherms living in variable and unpredictable environments, reproductive output is further influenced by precipitation and temperature via effects on food availability and limits on activity. We assembled multiple (n = 12) datasets on egg production for the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii across its range and used these data to build a range-wide predictive model of annual reproductive output as a function of annual weather variation and individual-level attributes (body size and prior-year reproductive status). Climate variables were more robust predictors of reproductive output than individual-level attributes, with overall reproductive output positively related to prior-year precipitation and an earlier start to the spring activity season, and negatively related to spring temperature extremes (monthly temperature range in March\textendash April). Reproductive output was highest for individuals with larger body sizes that reproduced in the previous year. Expected annual reproductive output from 1990-2018 varied from 2\textendash 5 eggs per female per year to 6-\textendash 12 eggs, with a weak decline in expected reproductive output over this time (p = 0.02). Climate-driven environmental variation in expected reproductive output was highly correlated across all 5 Recovery Units for this species (Pearson's r {$>$} 0.9). Overall, our model suggests that climate change could strongly impact Agassiz's desert tortoise reproductive output, and could have a negative population-level effect if precipitation is significantly reduced across the species' range as predicted under some climate models.},

We tested extraction protocols on scat samples from the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii, to evaluate whether scat-based mark\textendash recapture and population genetic monitoring studies are feasible. We extracted DNA from G. agassizii scat samples collected in California and Nevada using several extraction protocols and evaluated the reliability of resulting genotypes using quality scores, maximum likelihood reliability estimates, and paired scat and blood genotypes from the same individuals. Finally, we assessed probabilities of identity and sibship, and locus amplification quality, and calculated genotyping error rates for 19 microsatellite loci to determine the best set of loci to use with G. agassizii scat extractions. We found that genotype quality depended more on the sample quality than on the extraction method, and that the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini extraction kit is an efficient method for extracting DNA from tortoise scat. We identified 6 G. agassizii microsatellite loci that can be used to generate a unique molecular tag for individual tortoises. We characterized the reliability of an additional 13 microsatellite loci for use in population genetic analyses where additional power at the expense of some increase in error may be advantageous. As proof of concept, with very low error rates, we matched 3 opportunistically collected scat samples to blood genotypes from animals captured during population surveys within the study area and discovered at least 3 new individuals, even after 2 yrs of extensive survey work. These results suggest that genotyping of field-collected scat can complement existing methods used in long-term demographic and movement studies of G. agassizii and other, closely related, tortoise species.},

  abstract = {The Mojave Desert is a vast and diverse landscape in the southwestern United States, encompassing 127,689km2. This ecoregion is bordered by the colder and wetter Great Basin desert to the north, and the warmer and wetter Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts to the south. Spanning from 86m below sea level at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California, to 3632m at its highest mountains near Las Vegas, Nevada, the Mojave is the driest of the four North American deserts, in part due to the rain-shadow caused by the Transverse Ranges on its western edge. Extremes of moisture availability, temperature, physiographic variety, and soil diversity all are key in the formation of this unique landscape, and the divergence of its inhabitants over time. While the Mojave is often considered an intermediary with respect to the plants and animals that occupy the Great Basin and Sonoran Deserts, there are many species unique to the Mojave that aid in highlighting its unique characteristics. The Joshua Tree, Mojave Desert Tortoise, Mohave ground squirrel, and several species of fringe-toed lizards are all endemics to this ecoregion that have adapted to this austere environment. There is also a wide array of fishes and aquatic invertebrates that occupy the Mojave's sparse and discontinuous waterways and springs. Nearly all of these Mojave endemics are the subjects of conservation concern facing a rapidly changing environment driven by increasing human populations and land use, and a changing climate.},

  abstract = {We challenged the common practice of using a single mean absorptance based on unfiltered skylight spectra to model operative temperature for reptiles in filtered light habitats by examining the effects of plant canopies on light transmittance. To assess differences in light filtration over a range of microhabitats, spectra were recorded under canopies of desert plants, tropical plants, and under unfiltered skylight. Spectra were then integrated with absorptivity curves of desert reptiles to determine if differences in light quality among microhabitat types changed integrated mean absorptance. Finally, we used the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study to investigate the effects of filtered microhabitats on paint choice for physical operative temperature models and determined the magnitude of error that could result from discrepancies between paint and animal absorptance. We found that light energy was partitioned similarly among microhabitats with like canopy types and that most variation was explained by differences in transmittance between the visible and near infrared wavelengths. Mean absorptance for reptiles was similar among microhabitats with the greatest differences observed between animals in unfiltered skylight and under tropical canopies. In most microhabitats paint and tortoise absorptances differed, but operative temperatures were nearly identical within microhabitats no matter the absorptance used in the model. The findings of this study support the use of a single mean absorptance in modeling operative temperature for reptiles in a variety of habitats.},
